# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a collection of AI-generated HTML games that run directly in the browser and are served via GitHub Pages. Each game is a standalone HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript, requiring no build process or external dependencies.

## Key Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Start local development server
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in browser

# Alternative with Node.js if available
npx http-server -p 8000
```

### Deployment
```bash
# Changes pushed to main branch automatically deploy via GitHub Actions
git add .
git commit -m "Your message here"
git push origin main
```

## Architecture

### File Structure
- `index.html` - Main gallery page displaying all games as cards
- `games/` - Contains standalone HTML game files
- `docs/` - Markdown documentation for each game with iframe embedding
- `_config.yml` - Jekyll configuration for GitHub Pages
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment

### Adding New Games

1. **Create Game File**: Add a self-contained HTML file to `games/[gamename].html`
   - Must include all CSS and JavaScript inline
   - Should support fullscreen mode
   - Should have a back link to index.html
   - Use localStorage for persistent data (scores, settings)

2. **Create Documentation**: Add `docs/[gamename].md` with:
   - Game description and rules
   - Embedded iframe pointing to `../games/[gamename].html`
   - Fullscreen button functionality
   - Controls and tips

3. **Update Gallery**: Modify the `games` array in `index.html`:
   ```javascript
   {
       title: "Game Name",
       description: "Brief description",
       url: "games/[gamename].html",
       icon: "ðŸŽ®"  // Emoji icon for the card
   }
   ```

## Game Development Guidelines

### Required Features for Each Game
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Keyboard controls (and touch controls where applicable)
- Visual feedback for user actions
- Clear game over/win conditions
- Score tracking (optional but recommended)

### Common Patterns

**Fullscreen Toggle:**
```javascript
function toggleFullscreen() {
    if (!document.fullscreenElement) {
        document.documentElement.requestFullscreen();
    } else {
        if (document.exitFullscreen) {
            document.exitFullscreen();
        }
    }
}
```

**LocalStorage for High Scores:**
```javascript
// Save
localStorage.setItem('gameNameHighScore', score);
// Load
const highScore = localStorage.getItem('gameNameHighScore') || 0;
```

**Game Loop Pattern:**
```javascript
let gameRunning = false;
let gameLoop;

function startGame() {
    gameRunning = true;
    gameLoop = setInterval(update, 100);
}

function stopGame() {
    gameRunning = false;
    clearInterval(gameLoop);
}
```

## GitHub Pages Configuration

The site automatically deploys when changes are pushed to the main branch. The GitHub Actions workflow handles:
1. Building with Jekyll
2. Uploading artifacts
3. Deploying to GitHub Pages

URL structure after deployment:
- Main page: `https://[username].github.io/games/`
- Individual games: `https://[username].github.io/games/games/[gamename].html`
- Documentation: `https://[username].github.io/games/docs/[gamename]`

## Important Notes

- All games must be self-contained HTML files with no external dependencies
- Games should work offline once loaded
- Avoid using CDNs or external resources
- Keep file sizes reasonable (ideally under 100KB per game)
- Test games locally before pushing to ensure they work standalone
